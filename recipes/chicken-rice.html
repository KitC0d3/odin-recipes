        <p>Chicken rice is a popular dish made of tender, flavorful poached or roasted chicken served with fragrant rice cooked in chicken broth and fat, often accompanied by chili sauce, soy sauce, and sliced cucumbers. It’s especially famous as Hainanese chicken rice in Southeast Asia.</p>
        
        <p>Ingredients Needed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 whole chicken (about 1.5 kg / 3 lbs)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>4-5 slices fresh ginger</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
            <li>2-3 stalks spring onion (scallions)</li>
            <li>Water (enough to submerge the chicken)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Rub the chicken with salt to remove impurities, then rinse.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, fill with enough water to cover the chicken. Add ginger, garlic, and spring onions.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer. Add chicken and poach for 30–40 minutes, until cooked through.</li>
            <li>Transfer the chicken immediately to an ice bath to keep the skin firm and tender. Set aside.</li>
        </ol>
